//! Diagnostics over Internet Protocol definition library
//!
//! This crate is built to act a definitive source for defintions of ISO-13400
//! and `DoIP` protocol development. Using all the data structures provided one
//! should be able to develop applications with certainty that they are abiding
//! by regulatory standards.
//!
//! Each `DoIP` message contains a minimum length of 8 bytes of which is the
//! [`header`], within this the header contains the length of the [`message`]
//! and what type of payload the message is.

/// The `DoIP` header contains 4 items:
/// - Protocol Version
/// - Inverse Protocol Version
/// - Payload Type
/// - Payload Length
///
/// By default this library provides users with the option to use a different
/// protocol version than what is currently in use, this is for backwards and future
/// compatability.
///
/// The Inverse Protocol Version is the flipped byte of the protocol
/// version, this is to validate the packet.
///
/// The payload length is given in a `u32` but in this library is written in
/// `[u8; 4]` to remain close-to-network as possible.
///
/// This module contains the relevant structs, enums, and traits for developers
/// to create custom headers.
